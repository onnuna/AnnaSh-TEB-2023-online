The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
The target attribute can have one of the following values:
_self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
_blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
_top - Opens the document in the full body of the window
  Use the <a> element to define a link
Use the href attribute to define the link address
Use the target attribute to define where to open the linked document
Use the <img> element (inside <a>) to use an image as a link
Use the mailto: scheme inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program

  First, use the id attribute to create a bookmark:
<h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>
Then, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from within the same page:
Example
<a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>
You can also add a link to a bookmark on another page:
<a href="html_demo.html#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>
Chapter Summary
Use the id attribute (id="value") to define bookmarks in a page
Use the href attribute (href="#value") to link to the bookmark

  Use the HTML <img> element to define an image
Use the HTML src attribute to define the URL of the image
Use the HTML alt attribute to define an alternate text for an image, if it cannot be displayed
Use the HTML width and height attributes or the CSS width and height properties to define the size of the image
Use the CSS float property to let the image float to the left or to the right
Note: Loading large images takes time, and can slow down your web page. Use images carefully.

  You must define the shape of the clickable area, and you can choose one of these values:
rect - defines a rectangular region
circle - defines a circular region
poly - defines a polygonal region
default - defines the entire region
  Use the HTML <map> element to define an image map
Use the HTML <area> element to define the clickable areas in the image map
Use the HTML usemap attribute of the <img> element to point to an image map

  Shape="poly"
The shape="poly" contains several coordinate points, which creates a shape formed with straight lines (a polygon).
This can be used to create any shape.
Like maybe a croissant shape!
How can we make the croissant in the image below become a clickable link?
French Food
We have to find the x and y coordinates for all edges of the croissant:
French Food
The coordinates come in pairs, one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis:
Example
<area shape="poly" coords="140,121,181,116,204,160,204,222,191,270,140,329,85,355,58,352,37,322,40,259,103,161,128,147" href="croissant.htm">
