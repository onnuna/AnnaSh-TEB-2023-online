Note: The WHERE clause is not only used in SELECT statements, it is also used in UPDATE, DELETE, etc.!

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;


=	Equal	
>	Greater than	
<	Less than	
>=	Greater than or equal	
<=	Less than or equal	
<>	Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=	
BETWEEN	Between a certain range	
LIKE	Search for a pattern	
IN	To specify multiple possible values for a column


AND Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;

OR Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;

NOT Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE NOT condition;

Combining AND, OR and NOT
You can also combine the AND, OR and NOT operators.

The following SQL statement selects all fields from "Customers" where country is "Germany" AND city must be "Berlin" OR "Stuttgart" (use parenthesis to form complex expressions):

Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Germany' AND (City = 'Berlin' OR City = 'Stuttgart');


SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;

SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;

UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...

WHERE condition;Be careful when updating records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the UPDATE statement. 
The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) that should be updated. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be updated!
Be careful when updating records. If you omit the WHERE clause, ALL records will be updated!

DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

Be careful when deleting records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the DELETE statement. 
The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) should be deleted. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be deleted!

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
LIMIT number;

SELECT MIN(column_name) AS ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

SELECT MAX(column_name) AS ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

COUNT() Syntax
SELECT COUNT(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
The AVG() function returns the average value of a numeric column. 

AVG() Syntax
SELECT AVG(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
The SUM() function returns the total sum of a numeric column. 

SUM() Syntax
SELECT SUM(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:

The percent sign (%) represents zero, one, or multiple characters
The underscore sign (_) represents one, single character
The percent sign and the underscore can also be used in combinations!

LIKE Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;
Tip: You can also combine any number of conditions using AND or OR operators.

WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%'   Finds any values that start with "a"
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a'	 Finds any values that end with "a"
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%' Finds any values that have "or" in any position
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%'	 Finds any values that have "r" in the second position
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a_%'  Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 2 characters in length
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%' Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length
WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o'   Finds any values that start with "a" and ends with "o"

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName NOT LIKE 'a%';

Symbol	Description	Example
%	Represents zero or more characters	bl% finds bl, black, blue, and blob
_	Represents a single character	h_t finds hot, hat, and hit


LIKE Operator	Description
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%'    Finds any values that starts with "a"
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a'    Finds any values that ends with "a"
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%'  Finds any values that have "or" in any position
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%'   Finds any values that have "r" in the second position
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a_%_%'	Finds any values that starts with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length
WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o'	  Finds any values that starts with "a" and ends with "o"

IN Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);
or:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (SELECT STATEMENT);

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country NOT IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');

The BETWEEN operator selects values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates.

The BETWEEN operator is inclusive: begin and end values are included.

BETWEEN Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;

SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 20;

SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '1996-07-01' AND '1996-07-31';

Aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.

Aliases are often used to make column names more readable.

An alias only exists for the duration of that query.

An alias is created with the AS keyword.

Alias Column Syntax
SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;
Alias Table Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name AS alias_name;

SELECT CustomerID AS ID, CustomerName AS Customer
FROM Customers;
The following SQL statement creates two aliases, one for the CustomerName column and one for the ContactName column. 
Note: Single or double quotation marks are required if the alias name contains spaces:
SELECT CustomerName AS Customer, ContactName AS "Contact Person"
FROM Customers;
The following SQL statement creates an alias named "Address" that combine four columns (Address, PostalCode, City and Country):
SELECT CustomerName, CONCAT_WS(', ', Address, PostalCode, City, Country) AS Address
FROM Customers;

The following SQL statement selects all the orders from the customer with CustomerID=4 (Around the Horn). 
We use the "Customers" and "Orders" tables, and give them the table aliases of "c" and "o" respectively (Here we use aliases to make the SQL shorter):
SELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, c.CustomerName
FROM Customers AS c, Orders AS o
WHERE c.CustomerName='Around the Horn' AND c.CustomerID=o.CustomerID;

Aliases can be useful when:

There are more than one table involved in a query
Functions are used in the query
Column names are big or not very readable
Two or more columns are combined together

Supported Types of Joins in MySQL
INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as there is a match between the columns. 
If there are records in the "Orders" table that do not have matches in "Customers", these orders will not be shown!
LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (Customers), even if there are no matches in the right table (Orders).
RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (Employees), even if there are no matches in the left table (Orders).
CROSS JOIN: Returns all records from both tables
CROSS JOIN can potentially return very large result-sets!
The CROSS JOIN keyword returns all matching records from both tables whether the other table matches or not. 
So, if there are rows in "Customers" that do not have matches in "Orders", or if there are rows in "Orders" that do not have matches in "Customers", those rows will be listed as well.
If you add a WHERE clause (if table1 and table2 has a relationship), the CROSS JOIN will produce the same result as the INNER JOIN clause:
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
CROSS JOIN Orders
WHERE Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID;

Self Join Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1 T1, table1 T2
WHERE condition;
T1 and T2 are different table aliases for the same table.

The following SQL statement matches customers that are from the same city:
SELECT A.CustomerName AS CustomerName1, B.CustomerName AS CustomerName2, A.City
FROM Customers A, Customers B
WHERE A.CustomerID <> B.CustomerID
AND A.City = B.City
ORDER BY A.City;

The MySQL UNION Operator
The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.

Every SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns
The columns must also have similar data types
The columns in every SELECT statement must also be in the same order
UNION Syntax
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
UNION ALL Syntax
The UNION operator selects only distinct values by default. To allow duplicate values, use UNION ALL:

SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
Note: The column names in the result-set are usually equal to the column names in the first SELECT statement.

SQL UNION With WHERE
The following SQL statement returns the German cities (only distinct values) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:
Example
SELECT City, Country FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
UNION
SELECT City, Country FROM Suppliers
WHERE Country='Germany'
ORDER BY City;
SQL UNION ALL With WHERE
The following SQL statement returns the German cities (duplicate values also) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:
Example
SELECT City, Country FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
UNION ALL
SELECT City, Country FROM Suppliers
WHERE Country='Germany'
ORDER BY City;
Another UNION Example
The following SQL statement lists all customers and suppliers:
Example
SELECT 'Customer' AS Type, ContactName, City, Country
FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT 'Supplier', ContactName, City, Country
FROM Suppliers;
Notice the "AS Type" above - it is an alias. SQL Aliases are used to give a table or a column a temporary name. An alias only exists for the duration of the query. 
So, here we have created a temporary column named "Type", that list whether the contact person is a "Customer" or a "Supplier".

The MySQL GROUP BY Statement
The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".
The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns.
GROUP BY Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
ORDER BY column_name(s);
GROUP BY With JOIN Example
The following SQL statement lists the number of orders sent by each shipper:
Example
SELECT Shippers.ShipperName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders FROM Orders
LEFT JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID
GROUP BY ShipperName;


The MySQL HAVING Clause
The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.
HAVING Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column_name(s);

MySQL HAVING Examples
The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country. Only include countries with more than 5 customers:
Example
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5;
The following SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country, sorted high to low (Only include countries with more than 5 customers):
Example
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5
ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;

The following SQL statement lists the employees that have registered more than 10 orders:
Example
SELECT Employees.LastName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders
FROM (Orders
INNER JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID)
GROUP BY LastName
HAVING COUNT(Orders.OrderID) > 10;
The following SQL statement lists if the employees "Davolio" or "Fuller" have registered more than 25 orders:
Example
SELECT Employees.LastName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
WHERE LastName = 'Davolio' OR LastName = 'Fuller'
GROUP BY LastName
HAVING COUNT(Orders.OrderID) > 25;

The MySQL EXISTS Operator
The EXISTS operator is used to test for the existence of any record in a subquery.
The EXISTS operator returns TRUE if the subquery returns one or more records.
EXISTS Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE EXISTS
(SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);
The following SQL statement returns TRUE and lists the suppliers with a product price less than 20:
Example
SELECT SupplierName
FROM Suppliers
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE Products.SupplierID = Suppliers.supplierID AND Price < 20);
The following SQL statement returns TRUE and lists the suppliers with a product price equal to 22:
Example
SELECT SupplierName
FROM Suppliers
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE Products.SupplierID = Suppliers.supplierID AND Price = 22);

The MySQL ANY and ALL Operators
The ANY and ALL operators allow you to perform a comparison between a single column value and a range of other values.

The ANY Operator
The ANY operator:

returns a boolean value as a result
returns TRUE if ANY of the subquery values meet the condition
ANY means that the condition will be true if the operation is true for any of the values in the range.

ANY Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name operator ANY
  (SELECT column_name
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition);
Note: The operator must be a standard comparison operator (=, <>, !=, >, >=, <, or <=).

The ALL Operator
The ALL operator:

returns a boolean value as a result
returns TRUE if ALL of the subquery values meet the condition
is used with SELECT, WHERE and HAVING statements
ALL means that the condition will be true only if the operation is true for all values in the range.

ALL Syntax With SELECT
SELECT ALL column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
ALL Syntax With WHERE or HAVING
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name operator ALL
  (SELECT column_name
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition);
Note: The operator must be a standard comparison operator (=, <>, !=, >, >=, <, or <=).

The following SQL statement lists the ProductName if it finds ANY records in the OrderDetails table has Quantity equal to 10
(this will return TRUE because the Quantity column has some values of 10):
Example
SELECT ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID = ANY
  (SELECT ProductID
  FROM OrderDetails
  WHERE Quantity = 10);
The following SQL statement lists the ProductName if it finds ANY records in the OrderDetails table has Quantity larger than 99
(this will return TRUE because the Quantity column has some values larger than 99):
Example
SELECT ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID = ANY
  (SELECT ProductID
  FROM OrderDetails
  WHERE Quantity > 99);
The following SQL statement lists the ProductName if it finds ANY records in the OrderDetails table has Quantity larger than 1000
(this will return FALSE because the Quantity column has no values larger than 1000):
Example
SELECT ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID = ANY
  (SELECT ProductID
  FROM OrderDetails
  WHERE Quantity > 1000);
SQL ALL Examples
The following SQL statement lists ALL the product names:
Example
SELECT ALL ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE TRUE;
The following SQL statement lists the ProductName if ALL the records in the OrderDetails table has Quantity equal to 10. 
This will of course return FALSE because the Quantity column has many different values (not only the value of 10):
Example
SELECT ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID = ALL
  (SELECT ProductID
  FROM OrderDetails
  WHERE Quantity = 10);

  
The INSERT INTO SELECT statement copies data from one table and inserts it into another table.
The INSERT INTO SELECT statement requires that the data types in source and target tables matches.
Note: The existing records in the target table are unaffected.
INSERT INTO SELECT Syntax
Copy all columns from one table to another table:
INSERT INTO table2
SELECT * FROM table1
WHERE condition;
Copy only some columns from one table into another table:
INSERT INTO table2 (column1, column2, column3, ...)
SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
FROM table1
WHERE condition;

The following SQL statement copies "Suppliers" into "Customers" (the columns that are not filled with data, will contain NULL):
Example
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country)
SELECT SupplierName, City, Country FROM Suppliers;
The following SQL statement copies "Suppliers" into "Customers" (fill all columns):
Example
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
SELECT SupplierName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country FROM Suppliers;
The following SQL statement copies only the German suppliers into "Customers":
Example
INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country)
SELECT SupplierName, City, Country FROM Suppliers
WHERE Country='Germany';

The CASE statement goes through conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met (like an if-then-else statement). 
So, once a condition is true, it will stop reading and return the result. If no conditions are true, it returns the value in the ELSE clause.
If there is no ELSE part and no conditions are true, it returns NULL.
CASE Syntax
CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    WHEN conditionN THEN resultN
    ELSE result
END;

MySQL CASE Examples
The following SQL goes through conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met:
Example
SELECT OrderID, Quantity,
CASE
    WHEN Quantity > 30 THEN 'The quantity is greater than 30'
    WHEN Quantity = 30 THEN 'The quantity is 30'
    ELSE 'The quantity is under 30'
END AS QuantityText
FROM OrderDetails;
The following SQL will order the customers by City. However, if City is NULL, then order by Country:
Example
SELECT CustomerName, City, Country
FROM Customers
ORDER BY
(CASE
    WHEN City IS NULL THEN Country
    ELSE City
END);

MySQL IFNULL() and COALESCE() Functions
Look at the following "Products" table:

P_Id	ProductName	UnitPrice	UnitsInStock	UnitsOnOrder
1	Jarlsberg	10.45	16	15
2	Mascarpone	32.56	23	 
3	Gorgonzola	15.67	9	20
Suppose that the "UnitsOnOrder" column is optional, and may contain NULL values.

Look at the following SELECT statement:
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + UnitsOnOrder)
FROM Products;
In the example above, if any of the "UnitsOnOrder" values are NULL, the result will be NULL.
MySQL IFNULL() Function
The MySQL IFNULL() function lets you return an alternative value if an expression is NULL.
The example below returns 0 if the value is NULL:
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + IFNULL(UnitsOnOrder, 0))
FROM Products;
MySQL COALESCE() Function
Or we can use the COALESCE() function, like this:
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + COALESCE(UnitsOnOrder, 0))
FROM Products;


Single line comments start with --.
Any text between -- and the end of the line will be ignored (will not be executed).
The following example uses a single-line comment as an explanation:
Example
-- Select all:
SELECT * FROM Customers;
Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.
Any text between /* and */ will be ignored.
The following example uses a multi-line comment as an explanation:
Example
/*Select all the columns
of all the records
in the Customers table:*/
SELECT * FROM Customers;
The following example uses a multi-line comment to ignore many statements:
Example
/*SELECT * FROM Customers;
SELECT * FROM Products;
SELECT * FROM Orders;
SELECT * FROM Categories;*/
SELECT * FROM Suppliers;
To ignore just a part of a statement, also use the /* */ comment.
The following example uses a comment to ignore part of a line:
Example
SELECT CustomerName, /*City,*/ Country FROM Customers;
The following example uses a comment to ignore part of a statement:
Example
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE (CustomerName LIKE 'L%'
OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%' /*OR CustomerName LIKE 'S%'
OR CustomerName LIKE 'T%'*/ OR CustomerName LIKE 'W%')
AND Country='USA'
ORDER BY CustomerName;

The CREATE DATABASE statement is used to create a new SQL database.
Syntax
CREATE DATABASE databasename;
CREATE DATABASE Example
The following SQL statement creates a database called "testDB":
Example
CREATE DATABASE testDB;
Tip: Make sure you have admin privilege before creating any database. 
Once a database is created, you can check it in the list of databases with the following SQL command: SHOW DATABASES;
The DROP DATABASE statement is used to drop an existing SQL database.
Syntax
DROP DATABASE databasename;
Note: Be careful before dropping a database. Deleting a database will result in loss of complete information stored in the database!
DROP DATABASE Example
The following SQL statement drops the existing database "testDB":
ExampleGet your own SQL Server
DROP DATABASE testDB;
Tip: Make sure you have admin privilege before dropping any database. 
Once a database is dropped, you can check it in the list of databases with the following SQL command: SHOW DATABASES;
The CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table in a database.
Syntax
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    column3 datatype,
   ....
);
The column parameters specify the names of the columns of the table.
The datatype parameter specifies the type of data the column can hold (e.g. varchar, integer, date, etc.).
Tip: For an overview of the available data types, go to our complete Data Types Reference.
MySQL CREATE TABLE Example
The following example creates a table called "Persons" that contains five columns: PersonID, LastName, FirstName, Address, and City:
Example
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    PersonID int,
    LastName varchar(255),
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Address varchar(255),
    City varchar(255)
);
The PersonID column is of type int and will hold an integer.
The LastName, FirstName, Address, and City columns are of type varchar and will hold characters, and the maximum length for these fields is 255 characters.
The empty "Persons" table will now look like this:
PersonID	LastName	FirstName	Address	City
 	 	 	 	 
Tip: The empty "Persons" table can now be filled with data with the SQL INSERT INTO statement.
Create Table Using Another Table
A copy of an existing table can also be created using CREATE TABLE.
The new table gets the same column definitions. All columns or specific columns can be selected.
If you create a new table using an existing table, the new table will be filled with the existing values from the old table.
Syntax
CREATE TABLE new_table_name AS
    SELECT column1, column2,...
    FROM existing_table_name
    WHERE ....;
The following SQL creates a new table called "TestTables" (which is a copy of the "Customers" table): 
Example
CREATE TABLE TestTable AS
SELECT customername, contactname
FROM customers;
The DROP TABLE statement is used to drop an existing table in a database.
Syntax
DROP TABLE table_name;
Note: Be careful before dropping a table. Deleting a table will result in loss of complete information stored in the table!
MySQL DROP TABLE Example
The following SQL statement drops the existing table "Shippers":
Example
DROP TABLE Shippers;
MySQL TRUNCATE TABLE
The TRUNCATE TABLE statement is used to delete the data inside a table, but not the table itself.
Syntax
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.
The ALTER TABLE statement is also used to add and drop various constraints on an existing table.
ALTER TABLE - ADD Column
To add a column in a table, use the following syntax:
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name datatype;
The following SQL adds an "Email" column to the "Customers" table:
Example
ALTER TABLE Customers
ADD Email varchar(255);
ALTER TABLE - DROP COLUMN
To delete a column in a table, use the following syntax (notice that some database systems don't allow deleting a column):
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name;
The following SQL deletes the "Email" column from the "Customers" table:
Example
ALTER TABLE Customers
DROP COLUMN Email;
ALTER TABLE - MODIFY COLUMN
To change the data type of a column in a table, use the following syntax:
ALTER TABLE table_name
MODIFY COLUMN column_name datatype;
Change Data Type Example
Now we want to change the data type of the column named "DateOfBirth" in the "Persons" table.
We use the following SQL statement:
Example
ALTER TABLE Persons
MODIFY COLUMN DateOfBirth year;
Notice that the "DateOfBirth" column is now of type year and is going to hold a year in a two- or four-digit format.
DROP COLUMN Example
Next, we want to delete the column named "DateOfBirth" in the "Persons" table.
We use the following SQL statement:
Example
ALTER TABLE Persons
DROP COLUMN DateOfBirth;
Constraints can be specified when the table is created with the CREATE TABLE statement, or after the table is created with the ALTER TABLE statement.
Syntax
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype constraint,
    column2 datatype constraint,
    column3 datatype constraint,
    ....
);

MySQL Constraints
SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table.
Constraints are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. 
This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the table. If there is any violation between the constraint and the data action, the action is aborted.
Constraints can be column level or table level. Column level constraints apply to a column, and table level constraints apply to the whole table.
The following constraints are commonly used in SQL:
NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different
PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table
FOREIGN KEY - Prevents actions that would destroy links between tables
CHECK - Ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific condition
DEFAULT - Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified
CREATE INDEX - Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly

MySQL NOT NULL Constraint
By default, a column can hold NULL values.
The NOT NULL constraint enforces a column to NOT accept NULL values.
This enforces a field to always contain a value, which means that you cannot insert a new record, or update a record without adding a value to this field.
NOT NULL on CREATE TABLE
The following SQL ensures that the "ID", "LastName", and "FirstName" columns will NOT accept NULL values when the "Persons" table is created:
Example
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    Age int
);
NOT NULL on ALTER TABLE
To create a NOT NULL constraint on the "Age" column when the "Persons" table is already created, use the following SQL:
Example
ALTER TABLE Persons
MODIFY Age int NOT NULL;

The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different.
Both the UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints provide a guarantee for uniqueness for a column or set of columns.
A PRIMARY KEY constraint automatically has a UNIQUE constraint.
However, you can have many UNIQUE constraints per table, but only one PRIMARY KEY constraint per table.
UNIQUE Constraint on CREATE TABLE
The following SQL creates a UNIQUE constraint on the "ID" column when the "Persons" table is created:
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    UNIQUE (ID)
);
To name a UNIQUE constraint, and to define a UNIQUE constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    CONSTRAINT UC_Person UNIQUE (ID,LastName)
);
UNIQUE Constraint on ALTER TABLE
To create a UNIQUE constraint on the "ID" column when the table is already created, use the following SQL:
ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD UNIQUE (ID);
To name a UNIQUE constraint, and to define a UNIQUE constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:
ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD CONSTRAINT UC_Person UNIQUE (ID,LastName);
DROP a UNIQUE Constraint
To drop a UNIQUE constraint, use the following SQL:
ALTER TABLE Persons
DROP INDEX UC_Person;

The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table.
Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values.
A table can have only ONE primary key; and in the table, this primary key can consist of single or multiple columns (fields).
PRIMARY KEY on CREATE TABLE
The following SQL creates a PRIMARY KEY on the "ID" column when the "Persons" table is created:
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);
To allow naming of a PRIMARY KEY constraint, and for defining a PRIMARY KEY constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    CONSTRAINT PK_Person PRIMARY KEY (ID,LastName)
);
Note: In the example above there is only ONE PRIMARY KEY (PK_Person). However, the VALUE of the primary key is made up of TWO COLUMNS (ID + LastName).
PRIMARY KEY on ALTER TABLE
To create a PRIMARY KEY constraint on the "ID" column when the table is already created, use the following SQL:
ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD PRIMARY KEY (ID);
To allow naming of a PRIMARY KEY constraint, and for defining a PRIMARY KEY constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:
ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD CONSTRAINT PK_Person PRIMARY KEY (ID,LastName);
Note: If you use ALTER TABLE to add a primary key, the primary key column(s) must have been declared to not contain NULL values (when the table was first created).
DROP a PRIMARY KEY Constraint
To drop a PRIMARY KEY constraint, use the following SQL:
ALTER TABLE Persons
DROP PRIMARY KEY;

The FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables.
A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.
The table with the foreign key is called the child table, and the table with the primary key is called the referenced or parent table.
Notice that the "PersonID" column in the "Orders" table points to the "PersonID" column in the "Persons" table.
The "PersonID" column in the "Persons" table is the PRIMARY KEY in the "Persons" table.
The "PersonID" column in the "Orders" table is a FOREIGN KEY in the "Orders" table.
The FOREIGN KEY constraint prevents invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column, because it has to be one of the values contained in the parent table.
FOREIGN KEY on CREATE TABLE
The following SQL creates a FOREIGN KEY on the "PersonID" column when the "Orders" table is created:
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID int NOT NULL,
    OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
    PersonID int,
    PRIMARY KEY (OrderID),
    FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)
);
To allow naming of a FOREIGN KEY constraint, and for defining a FOREIGN KEY constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID int NOT NULL,
    OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
    PersonID int,
    PRIMARY KEY (OrderID),
    CONSTRAINT FK_PersonOrder FOREIGN KEY (PersonID)
    REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)
);
FOREIGN KEY on ALTER TABLE
To create a FOREIGN KEY constraint on the "PersonID" column when the "Orders" table is already created, use the following SQL:
ALTER TABLE Orders
ADD FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID);
To allow naming of a FOREIGN KEY constraint, and for defining a FOREIGN KEY constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:
ALTER TABLE Orders
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_PersonOrder
FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID);
DROP a FOREIGN KEY Constraint
To drop a FOREIGN KEY constraint, use the following SQL:
ALTER TABLE Orders
DROP FOREIGN KEY FK_PersonOrder;

MySQL CHECK Constraint
The CHECK constraint is used to limit the value range that can be placed in a column.
If you define a CHECK constraint on a column it will allow only certain values for this column.
If you define a CHECK constraint on a table it can limit the values in certain columns based on values in other columns in the row.
CHECK on CREATE TABLE
The following SQL creates a CHECK constraint on the "Age" column when the "Persons" table is created. The CHECK constraint ensures that the age of a person must be 18, or older:
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    CHECK (Age>=18)
);
To allow naming of a CHECK constraint, and for defining a CHECK constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    City varchar(255),
    CONSTRAINT CHK_Person CHECK (Age>=18 AND City='Sandnes')
);
CHECK on ALTER TABLE
To create a CHECK constraint on the "Age" column when the table is already created, use the following SQL:
ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD CHECK (Age>=18);
To allow naming of a CHECK constraint, and for defining a CHECK constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:
ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD CONSTRAINT CHK_PersonAge CHECK (Age>=18 AND City='Sandnes');
DROP a CHECK Constraint
To drop a CHECK constraint, use the following SQL:
ALTER TABLE Persons
DROP CHECK CHK_PersonAge;

The DEFAULT constraint is used to set a default value for a column.
The default value will be added to all new records, if no other value is specified.
DEFAULT on CREATE TABLE
The following SQL sets a DEFAULT value for the "City" column when the "Persons" table is created:
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    City varchar(255) DEFAULT 'Sandnes'
);
The DEFAULT constraint can also be used to insert system values, by using functions like CURRENT_DATE():
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
    OrderDate date DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE()
);
DEFAULT on ALTER TABLE
To create a DEFAULT constraint on the "City" column when the table is already created, use the following SQL:
ALTER TABLE Persons
ALTER City SET DEFAULT 'Sandnes';
DROP a DEFAULT Constraint
To drop a DEFAULT constraint, use the following SQL:
ALTER TABLE Persons
ALTER City DROP DEFAULT;

MySQL CREATE INDEX Statement
The CREATE INDEX statement is used to create indexes in tables.
Indexes are used to retrieve data from the database more quickly than otherwise. The users cannot see the indexes, they are just used to speed up searches/queries.
Note: Updating a table with indexes takes more time than updating a table without (because the indexes also need an update). 
So, only create indexes on columns that will be frequently searched against.
CREATE INDEX Syntax
Creates an index on a table. Duplicate values are allowed:
CREATE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX Syntax
Creates a unique index on a table. Duplicate values are not allowed:
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);
MySQL CREATE INDEX Example
The SQL statement below creates an index named "idx_lastname" on the "LastName" column in the "Persons" table:
CREATE INDEX idx_lastname
ON Persons (LastName);
If you want to create an index on a combination of columns, you can list the column names within the parentheses, separated by commas:
CREATE INDEX idx_pname
ON Persons (LastName, FirstName);
DROP INDEX Statement
The DROP INDEX statement is used to delete an index in a table.
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP INDEX index_name;

Auto-increment allows a unique number to be generated automatically when a new record is inserted into a table.
Often this is the primary key field that we would like to be created automatically every time a new record is inserted.
MySQL AUTO_INCREMENT Keyword
MySQL uses the AUTO_INCREMENT keyword to perform an auto-increment feature.
By default, the starting value for AUTO_INCREMENT is 1, and it will increment by 1 for each new record.
The following SQL statement defines the "Personid" column to be an auto-increment primary key field in the "Persons" table:
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    Personid int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    PRIMARY KEY (Personid)
);
To let the AUTO_INCREMENT sequence start with another value, use the following SQL statement:
ALTER TABLE Persons AUTO_INCREMENT=100;
When we insert a new record into the "Persons" table, we do NOT have to specify a value for the "Personid" column (a unique value will be added automatically):
INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName,LastName)
VALUES ('Lars','Monsen');
The SQL statement above would insert a new record into the "Persons" table. The "Personid" column would be assigned a unique value automatically. 
The "FirstName" column would be set to "Lars" and the "LastName" column would be set to "Monsen".

The most difficult part when working with dates is to be sure that the format of the date you are trying to insert, matches the format of the date column in the database.
As long as your data contains only the date portion, your queries will work as expected. However, if a time portion is involved, it gets more complicated.
MySQL Date Data Types
MySQL comes with the following data types for storing a date or a date/time value in the database:
DATE - format YYYY-MM-DD
DATETIME - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
TIMESTAMP - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
YEAR - format YYYY or YY
Note: The date data type are set for a column when you create a new table in your database!
Note: Two dates can easily be compared if there is no time component involved!
Tip: To keep your queries simple and easy to maintain, do not use time-components in your dates, unless you have to!

MySQL CREATE VIEW Statement
In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.
A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.
You can add SQL statements and functions to a view and present the data as if the data were coming from one single table.
A view is created with the CREATE VIEW statement.
CREATE VIEW Syntax
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
Note: A view always shows up-to-date data! The database engine recreates the view, every time a user queries it.
MySQL CREATE VIEW Examples
The following SQL creates a view that shows all customers from Brazil:
Example
CREATE VIEW [Brazil Customers] AS
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';
We can query the view above as follows:
Example
SELECT * FROM [Brazil Customers];
The following SQL creates a view that selects every product in the "Products" table with a price higher than the average price:
Example
CREATE VIEW [Products Above Average Price] AS
SELECT ProductName, Price
FROM Products
WHERE Price > (SELECT AVG(Price) FROM Products);
We can query the view above as follows:
Example
SELECT * FROM [Products Above Average Price];
MySQL Updating a View
A view can be updated with the CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW statement.
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW Syntax
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
The following SQL adds the "City" column to the "Brazil Customers" view:
Example
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW [Brazil Customers] AS
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, City
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';
MySQL Dropping a View
A view is deleted with the DROP VIEW statement.
DROP VIEW Syntax
DROP VIEW view_name;
The following SQL drops the "Brazil Customers" view:
Example
DROP VIEW [Brazil Customers];

The SELECT TOP clause is used to specify the number of records to return.
The SELECT TOP clause is useful on large tables with thousands of records. Returning a large number of records can impact performance.
ExampleGet your own SQL Server
Select only the first 3 records of the Customers table:
SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers;
Note: Not all database systems support the SELECT TOP clause. 
MySQL supports the LIMIT clause to select a limited number of records, while Oracle uses FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY and ROWNUM.
SQL Server / MS Access Syntax:
SELECT TOP number|percent column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
MySQL Syntax:
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
LIMIT number;
Oracle 12 Syntax:
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name(s)
FETCH FIRST number ROWS ONLY;
Older Oracle Syntax:
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE ROWNUM <= number;
Older Oracle Syntax (with ORDER BY):
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name(s))
WHERE ROWNUM <= number;
The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for MySQL:
Example
Select the first 3 records of the Customers table:
SELECT * FROM Customers
LIMIT 3;
The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for Oracle:
Example
Select the first 3 records of the Customers table:
SELECT * FROM Customers
FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;
The following SQL statement selects the first 50% of the records from the "Customers" table (for SQL Server/MS Access):
Example
SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM Customers;
The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for Oracle:
Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
FETCH FIRST 50 PERCENT ROWS ONLY;
ADD a WHERE CLAUSE
The following SQL statement selects the first three records from the "Customers" table, where the country is "Germany" (for SQL Server/MS Access):
Example
SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany';
The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for MySQL:
Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
LIMIT 3;
The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for Oracle:
Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;
ADD the ORDER BY Keyword
Add the ORDER BY keyword when you want to sort the result, and return the first 3 records of the sorted result.
For SQL Server and MS Access:
Example
Sort the result reverse alphabetically by CustomerName, and return the first 3 records:
SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers
ORDER BY CustomerName DESC;
The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for MySQL:
Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY CustomerName DESC
LIMIT 3;
The following SQL statement shows the equivalent example for Oracle:
Example
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY CustomerName DESC
FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;

Wildcard Characters
Symbol	Description
%	Represents zero or more characters
_	Represents a single character
[]	Represents any single character within the brackets *
^	Represents any character not in the brackets *
-	Represents any single character within the specified range *
{}	Represents any escaped character **
* Not supported in PostgreSQL and MySQL databases.
** Supported only in Oracle databases.
! Not

Microsoft Access Wildcards
The Microsoft Access Database has some other wildcards:

Symbol	Description	Example
*	Represents zero or more characters	bl* finds bl, black, blue, and blob
?	Represents a single character	h?t finds hot, hat, and hit
[]	Represents any single character within the brackets	h[oa]t finds hot and hat, but not hit
!	Represents any character not in the brackets	h[!oa]t finds hit, but not hot and hat
-	Represents any single character within the specified range	c[a-b]t finds cat and cbt
#	Represents any single numeric character	2#5 finds 205, 215, 225, 235, 245, 255, 265, 275, 285, and 295

IN (SELECT)
You can also use IN with a subquery in the WHERE clause.
With a subquery you can return all records from the main query that are present in the result of the subquery.
Example
Return all customers that have an order in the Orders table:
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders);
NOT IN (SELECT)
The result in the example above returned 74 records, that means that there are 17 customers that haven't placed any orders.
Let us check if that is correct, by using the NOT IN operator.
Example
Return all customers that have NOT placed any orders in the Orders table:
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID NOT IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders);
The following SQL statement creates two aliases, one for the CustomerID column and one for the CustomerName column:
Example
SELECT CustomerID AS ID, CustomerName AS Customer
FROM Customers;
Using Aliases With a Space Character
If you want your alias to contain one or more spaces, like "My Great Products", surround your alias with square brackets or double quotes.
Example
Using [square brackets] for aliases with space characters:
SELECT ProductName AS [My Great Products]
FROM Products;
Example
Using "double quotes" for aliases with space characters:
SELECT ProductName AS "My Great Products"
FROM Products;
Note: Some database systems allows both [] and "", and some only allows one of them.
Concatenate Columns
The following SQL statement creates an alias named "Address" that combine four columns (Address, PostalCode, City and Country):
Example
SELECT CustomerName, Address + ', ' + PostalCode + ' ' + City + ', ' + Country AS Address
FROM Customers;
Note: To get the SQL statement above to work in MySQL use the following:
MySQL Example
SELECT CustomerName, CONCAT(Address,', ',PostalCode,', ',City,', ',Country) AS Address
FROM Customers;
Note: To get the SQL statement above to work in Oracle use the following:
Oracle Example
SELECT CustomerName, (Address || ', ' || PostalCode || ' ' || City || ', ' || Country) AS Address
FROM Customers;
Alias for Tables
The same rules applies when you want to use an alias for a table.
Example
Refer to the Customers table as Persons instead:
SELECT * FROM Customers AS Persons;
It might seem useless to use aliases on tables, but when you are using more than one table in your queries, it can make the SQL statements shorter.
The following SQL statement selects all the orders from the customer with CustomerID=4 (Around the Horn). 
We use the "Customers" and "Orders" tables, and give them the table aliases of "c" and "o" respectively (Here we use aliases to make the SQL shorter):
Example
SELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, c.CustomerName
FROM Customers AS c, Orders AS o
WHERE c.CustomerName='Around the Horn' AND c.CustomerID=o.CustomerID;
The following SQL statement is the same as above, but without aliases:
Example
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Orders.OrderDate, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Customers, Orders
WHERE Customers.CustomerName='Around the Horn' AND Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID;
Aliases can be useful when:
There are more than one table involved in a query
Functions are used in the query
Column names are big or not very readable
Two or more columns are combined together

The SQL CASE Expression
The CASE expression goes through conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met (like an if-then-else statement). 
So, once a condition is true, it will stop reading and return the result. If no conditions are true, it returns the value in the ELSE clause.
If there is no ELSE part and no conditions are true, it returns NULL.
CASE Syntax
CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    WHEN conditionN THEN resultN
    ELSE result
END;

The SQL INSERT INTO SELECT Statement
The INSERT INTO SELECT statement copies data from one table and inserts it into another table.
The INSERT INTO SELECT statement requires that the data types in source and target tables match.
Note: The existing records in the target table are unaffected.
INSERT INTO SELECT Syntax
Copy all columns from one table to another table:
INSERT INTO table2
SELECT * FROM table1
WHERE condition;
Copy only some columns from one table into another table:
INSERT INTO table2 (column1, column2, column3, ...)
SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
FROM table1
WHERE condition;

SQL CASE Examples
The following SQL goes through conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met:
Example
SELECT OrderID, Quantity,
CASE
    WHEN Quantity > 30 THEN 'The quantity is greater than 30'
    WHEN Quantity = 30 THEN 'The quantity is 30'
    ELSE 'The quantity is under 30'
END AS QuantityText
FROM OrderDetails;
The following SQL will order the customers by City. However, if City is NULL, then order by Country:
Example
SELECT CustomerName, City, Country
FROM Customers
ORDER BY
(CASE
    WHEN City IS NULL THEN Country
    ELSE City
END);

MySQL
The MySQL IFNULL() function lets you return an alternative value if an expression is NULL:
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + IFNULL(UnitsOnOrder, 0))
FROM Products;
or we can use the COALESCE() function, like this:
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + COALESCE(UnitsOnOrder, 0))
FROM Products;
SQL Server
The SQL Server ISNULL() function lets you return an alternative value when an expression is NULL:
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + ISNULL(UnitsOnOrder, 0))
FROM Products;
or we can use the COALESCE() function, like this:
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + COALESCE(UnitsOnOrder, 0))
FROM Products;
MS Access
The MS Access IsNull() function returns TRUE (-1) if the expression is a null value, otherwise FALSE (0):
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + IIF(IsNull(UnitsOnOrder), 0, UnitsOnOrder))
FROM Products;
Oracle
The Oracle NVL() function achieves the same result:
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + NVL(UnitsOnOrder, 0))
FROM Products;
or we can use the COALESCE() function, like this:
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + COALESCE(UnitsOnOrder, 0))
FROM Products;

A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again.
So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again, save it as a stored procedure, and then just call it to execute it.
You can also pass parameters to a stored procedure, so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value(s) that is passed.
Stored Procedure Syntax
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
AS
sql_statement
GO;
Execute a Stored Procedure
EXEC procedure_name;
Stored Procedure With One Parameter
The following SQL statement creates a stored procedure that selects Customers from a particular City from the "Customers" table:
Example
CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers @City nvarchar(30)
AS
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = @City
GO;
Execute the stored procedure above as follows:
Example
EXEC SelectAllCustomers @City = 'London';
Stored Procedure With Multiple Parameters
Setting up multiple parameters is very easy. Just list each parameter and the data type separated by a comma as shown below.
The following SQL statement creates a stored procedure that selects Customers from a particular City with a particular PostalCode from the "Customers" table:
Example
CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers @City nvarchar(30), @PostalCode nvarchar(10)
AS
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = @City AND PostalCode = @PostalCode
GO;
Execute the stored procedure above as follows:
Example
EXEC SelectAllCustomers @City = 'London', @PostalCode = 'WA1 1DP';

The SQL BACKUP DATABASE Statement
The BACKUP DATABASE statement is used in SQL Server to create a full back up of an existing SQL database.
Syntax
BACKUP DATABASE databasename
TO DISK = 'filepath';
The SQL BACKUP WITH DIFFERENTIAL Statement
A differential back up only backs up the parts of the database that have changed since the last full database backup.
Syntax
BACKUP DATABASE databasename
TO DISK = 'filepath'
WITH DIFFERENTIAL;
BACKUP DATABASE Example
The following SQL statement creates a full back up of the existing database "testDB" to the D disk:
ExampleGet your own SQL Server
BACKUP DATABASE testDB
TO DISK = 'D:\backups\testDB.bak';
Tip: Always back up the database to a different drive than the actual database. Then, if you get a disk crash, you will not lose your backup file along with the database.
BACKUP WITH DIFFERENTIAL Example
The following SQL statement creates a differential back up of the database "testDB":
Example
BACKUP DATABASE testDB
TO DISK = 'D:\backups\testDB.bak'
WITH DIFFERENTIAL;
Tip: A differential back up reduces the back up time (since only the changes are backed up).

SQL ALTER TABLE Statement
The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.
The ALTER TABLE statement is also used to add and drop various constraints on an existing table.
ALTER TABLE - ADD Column
To add a column in a table, use the following syntax:
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name datatype;
The following SQL adds an "Email" column to the "Customers" table:
Example
ALTER TABLE Customers
ADD Email varchar(255);
ALTER TABLE - DROP COLUMN
To delete a column in a table, use the following syntax (notice that some database systems don't allow deleting a column):
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name;
The following SQL deletes the "Email" column from the "Customers" table:
Example
ALTER TABLE Customers
DROP COLUMN Email;
ALTER TABLE - RENAME COLUMN
To rename a column in a table, use the following syntax:
ALTER TABLE table_name
RENAME COLUMN old_name to new_name;
ALTER TABLE - ALTER/MODIFY DATATYPE
To change the data type of a column in a table, use the following syntax:
SQL Server / MS Access:
ALTER TABLE table_name
ALTER COLUMN column_name datatype;
My SQL / Oracle (prior version 10G):
ALTER TABLE table_name
MODIFY COLUMN column_name datatype;
Oracle 10G and later:
ALTER TABLE table_name
MODIFY column_name datatype;
Change Data Type Example
Now we want to change the data type of the column named "DateOfBirth" in the "Persons" table.
We use the following SQL statement:
ALTER TABLE Persons
ALTER COLUMN DateOfBirth year;
Notice that the "DateOfBirth" column is now of type year and is going to hold a year in a two- or four-digit format.
DROP COLUMN Example
Next, we want to delete the column named "DateOfBirth" in the "Persons" table.
We use the following SQL statement:
ALTER TABLE Persons
DROP COLUMN DateOfBirth;
The following constraints are commonly used in SQL:
NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different
PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table
FOREIGN KEY - Prevents actions that would destroy links between tables
CHECK - Ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific condition
DEFAULT - Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified
CREATE INDEX - Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly


SQL UNIQUE Constraint
The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different.
Both the UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints provide a guarantee for uniqueness for a column or set of columns.
A PRIMARY KEY constraint automatically has a UNIQUE constraint.
However, you can have many UNIQUE constraints per table, but only one PRIMARY KEY constraint per table.
SQL UNIQUE Constraint on CREATE TABLE
The following SQL creates a UNIQUE constraint on the "ID" column when the "Persons" table is created:
SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int
);
MySQL:
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    UNIQUE (ID)
);
To name a UNIQUE constraint, and to define a UNIQUE constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:
MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    CONSTRAINT UC_Person UNIQUE (ID,LastName)
);
SQL UNIQUE Constraint on ALTER TABLE
To create a UNIQUE constraint on the "ID" column when the table is already created, use the following SQL:
MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:
ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD UNIQUE (ID);
To name a UNIQUE constraint, and to define a UNIQUE constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:
MySQL / SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:
ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD CONSTRAINT UC_Person UNIQUE (ID,LastName);
DROP a UNIQUE Constraint
To drop a UNIQUE constraint, use the following SQL:
MySQL:
ALTER TABLE Persons
DROP INDEX UC_Person;
SQL Server / Oracle / MS Access:
ALTER TABLE Persons
DROP CONSTRAINT UC_Person;

SQL Date Data Types
MySQL comes with the following data types for storing a date or a date/time value in the database:
DATE - format YYYY-MM-DD
DATETIME - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
TIMESTAMP - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
YEAR - format YYYY or YY
SQL Server comes with the following data types for storing a date or a date/time value in the database:
DATE - format YYYY-MM-DD
DATETIME - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
SMALLDATETIME - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
TIMESTAMP - format: a unique number
Note: The date types are chosen for a column when you create a new table in your database!

SQL CREATE VIEW Statement
In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.
A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.
You can add SQL statements and functions to a view and present the data as if the data were coming from one single table.
A view is created with the CREATE VIEW statement. 
CREATE VIEW Syntax
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
Note: A view always shows up-to-date data! The database engine recreates the view, every time a user queries it.
SQL CREATE VIEW Examples
The following SQL creates a view that shows all customers from Brazil:
Example
CREATE VIEW [Brazil Customers] AS
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';
We can query the view above as follows:
Example
SELECT * FROM [Brazil Customers];
The following SQL creates a view that selects every product in the "Products" table with a price higher than the average price:
Example
CREATE VIEW [Products Above Average Price] AS
SELECT ProductName, Price
FROM Products
WHERE Price > (SELECT AVG(Price) FROM Products);
We can query the view above as follows:
Example
SELECT * FROM [Products Above Average Price];
SQL Updating a View
A view can be updated with the CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW statement.
SQL CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW Syntax
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
The following SQL adds the "City" column to the "Brazil Customers" view:
Example
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW [Brazil Customers] AS
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, City
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';
SQL Dropping a View
A view is deleted with the DROP VIEW statement.
SQL DROP VIEW Syntax
DROP VIEW view_name;
The following SQL drops the "Brazil Customers" view:
Example
DROP VIEW [Brazil Customers];

SQL Injection
SQL injection is a code injection technique that might destroy your database.
SQL injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques.
SQL injection is the placement of malicious code in SQL statements, via web page input.
SQL in Web Pages
SQL injection usually occurs when you ask a user for input, like their username/userid, 
  and instead of a name/id, the user gives you an SQL statement that you will unknowingly run on your database.
Look at the following example which creates a SELECT statement by adding a variable (txtUserId) to a select string. The variable is fetched from user input (getRequestString):
Example
txtUserId = getRequestString("UserId");
txtSQL = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = " + txtUserId;
The rest of this chapter describes the potential dangers of using user input in SQL statements.
SQL Injection Based on 1=1 is Always True
Look at the example above again. The original purpose of the code was to create an SQL statement to select a user, with a given user id.
If there is nothing to prevent a user from entering "wrong" input, the user can enter some "smart" input like this:
UserId: 
105 OR 1=1
Then, the SQL statement will look like this:
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = 105 OR 1=1;
The SQL above is valid and will return ALL rows from the "Users" table, since OR 1=1 is always TRUE.
Does the example above look dangerous? What if the "Users" table contains names and passwords?
The SQL statement above is much the same as this:
SELECT UserId, Name, Password FROM Users WHERE UserId = 105 or 1=1;
A hacker might get access to all the user names and passwords in a database, by simply inserting 105 OR 1=1 into the input field.
SQL Injection Based on ""="" is Always True
Here is an example of a user login on a web site:
Username:
John Doe
Password:
myPass
Example
uName = getRequestString("username");
uPass = getRequestString("userpassword");
sql = 'SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name ="' + uName + '" AND Pass ="' + uPass + '"'
Result
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name ="John Doe" AND Pass ="myPass"
A hacker might get access to user names and passwords in a database by simply inserting " OR ""=" into the user name or password text box:
User Name:
" or ""="
Password:
" or ""="
The code at the server will create a valid SQL statement like this:
Result
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name ="" or ""="" AND Pass ="" or ""=""
The SQL above is valid and will return all rows from the "Users" table, since OR ""="" is always TRUE.
SQL Injection Based on Batched SQL Statements 
Most databases support batched SQL statement.
A batch of SQL statements is a group of two or more SQL statements, separated by semicolons.
The SQL statement below will return all rows from the "Users" table, then delete the "Suppliers" table.
Example
SELECT * FROM Users; DROP TABLE Suppliers
Look at the following example:
Example
txtUserId = getRequestString("UserId");
txtSQL = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = " + txtUserId;
And the following input:
User id: 
105; DROP TABLE Suppliers
The valid SQL statement would look like this:
Result
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = 105; DROP TABLE Suppliers;
Use SQL Parameters for Protection
To protect a web site from SQL injection, you can use SQL parameters.
SQL parameters are values that are added to an SQL query at execution time, in a controlled manner.
ASP.NET Razor Example
txtUserId = getRequestString("UserId");
txtSQL = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = @0";
db.Execute(txtSQL,txtUserId);
Note that parameters are represented in the SQL statement by a @ marker.
The SQL engine checks each parameter to ensure that it is correct for its column and are treated literally, and not as part of the SQL to be executed.
Another Example
txtNam = getRequestString("CustomerName");
txtAdd = getRequestString("Address");
txtCit = getRequestString("City");
txtSQL = "INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName,Address,City) Values(@0,@1,@2)";
db.Execute(txtSQL,txtNam,txtAdd,txtCit);
Examples
The following examples shows how to build parameterized queries in some common web languages.
SELECT STATEMENT IN ASP.NET:
txtUserId = getRequestString("UserId");
sql = "SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerId = @0";
command = new SqlCommand(sql);
command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@0",txtUserId);
command.ExecuteReader();
INSERT INTO STATEMENT IN ASP.NET:
txtNam = getRequestString("CustomerName");
txtAdd = getRequestString("Address");
txtCit = getRequestString("City");
txtSQL = "INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName,Address,City) Values(@0,@1,@2)";
command = new SqlCommand(txtSQL);
command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@0",txtNam);
command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@1",txtAdd);
command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@2",txtCit);
command.ExecuteNonQuery();
INSERT INTO STATEMENT IN PHP:
$stmt = $dbh->prepare("INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName,Address,City)
VALUES (:nam, :add, :cit)");
$stmt->bindParam(':nam', $txtNam);
$stmt->bindParam(':add', $txtAdd);
$stmt->bindParam(':cit', $txtCit);
$stmt->execute();


SQL Hosting
If you want your web site to be able to store and retrieve data from a database, your web server should have access to a database-system that uses the SQL language.
If your web server is hosted by an Internet Service Provider (ISP), you will have to look for SQL hosting plans.
The most common SQL hosting databases are MS SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, and MS Access.
MS SQL Server
Microsoft's SQL Server is a popular database software for database-driven web sites with high traffic.
SQL Server is a very powerful, robust and full featured SQL database system.
Oracle
Oracle is also a popular database software for database-driven web sites with high traffic.
Oracle is a very powerful, robust and full featured SQL database system.
MySQL
MySQL is also a popular database software for web sites.
MySQL is a very powerful, robust and full featured SQL database system.
MySQL is an inexpensive alternative to the expensive Microsoft and Oracle solutions.
MS Access
When a web site requires only a simple database, Microsoft Access can be a solution.
MS Access is not well suited for very high-traffic, and not as powerful as MySQL, SQL Server, or Oracle.

The data type of a column defines what value the column can hold: integer, character, money, date and time, binary, and so on.

SQL Data Types
Each column in a database table is required to have a name and a data type.

An SQL developer must decide what type of data that will be stored inside each column when creating a table. The data type is a guideline for SQL to understand what type of data is expected inside of each column, and it also identifies how SQL will interact with the stored data.

Note: Data types might have different names in different database. And even if the name is the same, the size and other details may be different! Always check the documentation!

MySQL Data Types (Version 8.0)
In MySQL there are three main data types: string, numeric, and date and time.

String Data Types
Data type	Description
CHAR(size)	A FIXED length string (can contain letters, numbers, and special characters). The size parameter specifies the column length in characters - can be from 0 to 255. Default is 1
VARCHAR(size)	A VARIABLE length string (can contain letters, numbers, and special characters). The size parameter specifies the maximum string length in characters - can be from 0 to 65535
BINARY(size)	Equal to CHAR(), but stores binary byte strings. The size parameter specifies the column length in bytes. Default is 1
VARBINARY(size)	Equal to VARCHAR(), but stores binary byte strings. The size parameter specifies the maximum column length in bytes.
TINYBLOB	For BLOBs (Binary Large Objects). Max length: 255 bytes
TINYTEXT	Holds a string with a maximum length of 255 characters
TEXT(size)	Holds a string with a maximum length of 65,535 bytes
BLOB(size)	For BLOBs (Binary Large Objects). Holds up to 65,535 bytes of data
MEDIUMTEXT	Holds a string with a maximum length of 16,777,215 characters
MEDIUMBLOB	For BLOBs (Binary Large Objects). Holds up to 16,777,215 bytes of data
LONGTEXT	Holds a string with a maximum length of 4,294,967,295 characters
LONGBLOB	For BLOBs (Binary Large Objects). Holds up to 4,294,967,295 bytes of data
ENUM(val1, val2, val3, ...)	A string object that can have only one value, chosen from a list of possible values. You can list up to 65535 values in an ENUM list. If a value is inserted that is not in the list, a blank value will be inserted. The values are sorted in the order you enter them
SET(val1, val2, val3, ...)	A string object that can have 0 or more values, chosen from a list of possible values. You can list up to 64 values in a SET list
Numeric Data Types
Data type	Description
BIT(size)	A bit-value type. The number of bits per value is specified in size. The size parameter can hold a value from 1 to 64. The default value for size is 1.
TINYINT(size)	A very small integer. Signed range is from -128 to 127. Unsigned range is from 0 to 255. The size parameter specifies the maximum display width (which is 255)
BOOL	Zero is considered as false, nonzero values are considered as true.
BOOLEAN	Equal to BOOL
SMALLINT(size)	A small integer. Signed range is from -32768 to 32767. Unsigned range is from 0 to 65535. The size parameter specifies the maximum display width (which is 255)
MEDIUMINT(size)	A medium integer. Signed range is from -8388608 to 8388607. Unsigned range is from 0 to 16777215. The size parameter specifies the maximum display width (which is 255)
INT(size)	A medium integer. Signed range is from -2147483648 to 2147483647. Unsigned range is from 0 to 4294967295. The size parameter specifies the maximum display width (which is 255)
INTEGER(size)	Equal to INT(size)
BIGINT(size)	A large integer. Signed range is from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807. Unsigned range is from 0 to 18446744073709551615. The size parameter specifies the maximum display width (which is 255)
FLOAT(size, d)	A floating point number. The total number of digits is specified in size. The number of digits after the decimal point is specified in the d parameter. This syntax is deprecated in MySQL 8.0.17, and it will be removed in future MySQL versions
FLOAT(p)	A floating point number. MySQL uses the p value to determine whether to use FLOAT or DOUBLE for the resulting data type. If p is from 0 to 24, the data type becomes FLOAT(). If p is from 25 to 53, the data type becomes DOUBLE()
DOUBLE(size, d)	A normal-size floating point number. The total number of digits is specified in size. The number of digits after the decimal point is specified in the d parameter
DOUBLE PRECISION(size, d)	 
DECIMAL(size, d)	An exact fixed-point number. The total number of digits is specified in size. The number of digits after the decimal point is specified in the d parameter. The maximum number for size is 65. The maximum number for d is 30. The default value for size is 10. The default value for d is 0.
DEC(size, d)	Equal to DECIMAL(size,d)
